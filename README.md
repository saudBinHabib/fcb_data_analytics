Welcome to the FCB Data Providers project. This project is designed to help you read and analyze data from various data providers. Follow the instructions below to get started.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:saudBinHabib/fcb_data_analytics.git
   cd fcb_data_analytics
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirement/dev.txt
   ```

3. Installing fcb_data_provider package.
   ```sh
   pip install -e .
   ```

## üìä Features

- SQLAlchemy
- Pydantic
- Pandas
- Logging
- Docker
- pre-commit hooks

## Using `fcb_data_providers` package

The `src.fcb_data_providers.providers` module contains classes to read data from various data providers. Here's an example of how to use these classes:

```python
from src.fcb_data_providers.providers import StatsPerformProvider

# StatsPerformProvider needs DATABASE_URL, and Data directory as parameters, for which you can either crete variables or get that from your environment variables. e.g.

DATABASE_URL=os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
DATA_DIR = os.getenv("DATA_DIR")

# Initialize the data provider
stats_perform = StatsPerformProvider(data_path=DATA_DIR, database_url=DATABASE_URL)

# You can get the Events files list like this.
match_event_files = stats_perform.get_match_related_files(file_type="match_event")
stats_perform.logger.info(f"Match event files: {match_event_files}")

# You can get the match stats files list like this.
match_stat_files = stats_perform.get_match_related_files(file_type="match_stats")
stats_perform.logger.info(f"Match stats files: {match_stat_files}")

# You can process match events data like this.
stats_perform.process_match_event_data(file_path_list=match_event_files)

# You can process match stats data like this.
stats_perform.process_match_stats_data(file_path_list=match_event_files)

# Or if you want to do complete processing of the events, and stats data, you can use following.
# This function will read events, and stats file from data_dir, and will do complete processing.
stats_perform.process_data()

```

## Running Tests

To ensure everything is working correctly, you can run the tests included in the project. Use the following command to run the tests:

```sh
pytest
```

Make sure you have `pytest` installed. If not, you can install it using:

```sh
pip install pytest
```

## Data Exploration Using Jupyter Notebooks

The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration. To start exploring the data, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory:

   ```sh
   cd notebooks
   ```

2. Create Jupyter Notebook:

   ```sh
   touch data-exploration.ipynb
   ```

3. Open any of the notebooks to start exploring the data.
